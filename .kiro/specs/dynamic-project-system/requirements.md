# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dynamic Project System feature will transform the current hardcoded project display into a flexible, JSON-based system that allows for easy addition, modification, and management of portfolio projects. This system will maintain the existing visual design while providing a scalable backend structure for project data management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to see all projects displayed dynamically from a centralized data source, so that I always see the most up-to-date project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the homepage loads THEN the system SHALL fetch project data from JSON files
2. WHEN project data is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL display project cards with correct information
3. WHEN project data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a fallback message
4. WHEN no projects exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate "no projects" message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio owner, I want to add new projects by simply creating JSON files, so that I can easily expand my portfolio without modifying code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new project JSON file is created in the correct directory THEN the system SHALL automatically include it in the project list
2. WHEN project JSON follows the defined schema THEN the system SHALL display all project information correctly
3. WHEN project JSON contains images THEN the system SHALL display them in the project carousel
4. WHEN project JSON contains tags THEN the system SHALL display them as styled badges

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to view detailed project information, so that I can understand the scope and technical details of each project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a project card THEN the system SHALL navigate to a detailed project page
2. WHEN the project detail page loads THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive project information
3. WHEN the project has multiple images THEN the system SHALL display them in an interactive carousel
4. WHEN the project has technical details THEN the system SHALL display them in organized sections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a portfolio owner, I want the system to support bilingual content, so that both French and English visitors can understand my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project JSON contains both French and English content THEN the system SHALL display content based on current language setting
2. WHEN language is switched THEN all project content SHALL update to the selected language
3. WHEN only one language is provided THEN the system SHALL use that language for both settings
4. WHEN project detail pages load THEN they SHALL respect the current language preference

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want the project system to work seamlessly on mobile devices, so that I can browse projects on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing projects on mobile THEN the layout SHALL adapt to smaller screens
2. WHEN interacting with project carousels on mobile THEN touch gestures SHALL work properly
3. WHEN loading projects on mobile THEN the system SHALL optimize for mobile performance
4. WHEN viewing project details on mobile THEN all content SHALL be readable and accessible
